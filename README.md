# About Me:
---
I consider myself a proactive person when it comes to working both individually and in groups. I am easy to communicate with my project partners in order to move the project forward. I am an active learner and have a fast learning curve. I can be indispensable in any job thanks to my basic skills such as teamwork and dedication, in addition to my computer skills as you will see marked in my profile.
